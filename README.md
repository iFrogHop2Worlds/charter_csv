# Charter csv
Is a cross-platform program to navigate and visualize the data in your csv files. The main goal of this project
is to provide a free tool that is highly performant both at the software level and user workflow level.


# Features
- Out of the box support for large files. No need to configure any special setup or pay for a premium plan 
just to work with millions or billions of rows of data, you get that free. 
- Multiple file support. Allowing for efficient and more interesting analysis. 
- Sessions allow you to save and reconstruct your session state, for a consistent, reliable experience and greater depth of analysis.
- Simple intuitive query pipeline builder. No need to learn any query languages.   
- Simple csv file editor.
- Export graphs and charts as images.

# CSVQB
Were playing with the idea of using common math and logical operators to construct pipelines which can query and perform
transformations on your data. Were calling this csvqb or 'csv query builder'.

csvqb is in early development and far from complete. csvqb uses a hybrid infix and reverse polish notation approach
to construct operation pipelines. Operations are performed on a 2dVector representation of the csv files. 
This will later get abstracted into a crate.

# Future road map
Future versions will have:
- Ai assistant to construct pipelines.
- Device sync.
- Simulations.
- Improved file editor.
- Cross file pipelines.
- Additional graphing features.
- Teams/Organization support.
- Refactored codebase and continuous updates including performance optimizations.

please feel free to fork, make pr's and raise issues.
